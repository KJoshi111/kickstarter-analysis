# Overview of the Project:

## Purpose and background:

In this project we are analyzing the data for different types of shows in different countries. We have the names of the shows, story type, country of origin, dates of deadlines, launched at, etc. We are presenting the data in the format which is easy to understand for other team members.

## Some Challenges We Overcame:

A challenge is that the dataset has many categories and subcategories and it is a relatively large data sample in raw format. So, to make it more user-friendly we are using different types of tables and graphs. We are also showing separated categories and subcategories. We are also separating them by other parameters like outcomes and years, which helps us analyze and understand the data better. E.G we separated the data based on launching date in one work sheet and in other we separated it by the outcomes. Then, we added graphs. Which makes it so much easier to understand, because it shows according to the goals how many total projects were successful and how many failed or were cancelled., which was tougher to see in the original dataset.


## Results:

Here are the clear conclusions we can derive from the different methods of separating data.

1.	Analyzing theater outcomes by the launch date, we can conclude that the rate of success of theatrical entertainment is higher during August. We can also conclude that the rate of failure and rate of success of theatrical entertainment is equivalent during the month of August.:

2.	Analyzing overall outcomes based on goals, we can conclude that the rate of success is higher with a goal of less than 1000:

## A Summary of the Limitations:
In this data set we do not have the details about the level of success - e.g., we know that under the goal of $1000, there is a 71% success rate, but we can not derive the main factor for success or what makes the shows a success. We also cannot see how successful each show was. The type of show does not have any use here in this analysis. Furthermore, the “blurb” field in the original dataset has no relation to any show’s success, cancellation or failure. This extra information makes it vague. 


## Additional Tables or Graphs That Could be Made:
I would recommend to represent the data with a pivot table and/or a graph comparing the parent category, so we can also compare which category has a better success rate. That information can be more useful for the authors and people who decide to present the shows to public.
