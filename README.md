# Overview of the Project:

## * Purpose and background:
      In this project we are analyzing the data for different types of the shows in different countries. We have the names of the shows, story type, country of origin, dates of deadlines and launched at etc. We are presenting the data in the format which is easy to understand for other team members.

## * Some challenges we overcame:
      Here the challenge is that the dataset has many categories and subcategories and it is relatively large data sample in very raw format. So, to make it more understandable we are using different types of tables and graphs. Also, we are showing separated categories in to subcategories and also separating them by other parameters like outcomes and years. Which helps us to analyze and understand it better. E.G we separated the data based on launching date in one work sheet and in other we separated it by the outcomes. And then we added graphs. Which makes it so much easier to understand that according to the goals how many total projects were successful and how many failed or cancelled. Which was not possible to see that easily in the original dataset.


# * Results:
      Here are the clear conclusions we can derive from the different methods of separating data.

1.	Analyzing theater outcomes by the launch date, we can conclude that the rate of success of theatrical entertainment is higher during August:

2.	Analyzing overall outcomes based on goals, we can conclude that the rate of success is higher with a goal of less than 1000:
